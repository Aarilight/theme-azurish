# 1.4.0

- Tooltips, suggestions, and lists now use greys for selected items rather than teals.
- The borders of tooltips & suggestions have been changed to greys to match the context menus.
- The border of focused elements has been changed to blue (from teal).
- The default status bar colour has been changed to a navy blue.
- The debugging status bar colour has been changed to green.


# 1.3.0

- VSCode 1.28 (September) broke the context menu backgrounds. They were never explicitly styled in this theme, this theme just rode on whatever the default colours were. This release explicitly styles them â€” they should fit the theme a lot more now.


# 1.2.0

- Added support for the custom title bar. 
- Fixed the background colours of the sidebar section headings.


# 1.1.0

- Added support for git modifications/untracked/deleted files in the file explorer.


# 1.0.0

Initial release!
