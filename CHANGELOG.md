# 1.3.0

- VSCode 1.28 (September) broke the context menu backgrounds. They were never explicitly styled in this theme, this theme just rode on whatever the default colours were. This release explicitly styles them â€” they should fit the theme a lot more now.


# 1.2.0

- Added support for the custom title bar. 
- Fixed the background colours of the sidebar section headings.


# 1.1.0

# 1.0.0

Initial release!
